## Project Title - Share, Cook, Enjoy Online Cookbook

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my third milestone project for The Code Institute
 
Share, Cook, Enjoy is a simple way for online user to view, create, share and store their favourite recipes. 
For this backend development project I am going to create a web application that allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) recipes stored within a database. 

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my third milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase the new skills that 
I have learnt from The Code Institute and previous skill learnt from other projects. The primary skills being showcased here is 
going be Python and its libraries, as well as the Materialize Framework instead of the Bootstrap Framework.
