## Project Title - Share, Cook, Enjoy Online Cookbook

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my third milestone project for The Code Institute
 
Share, Cook, Enjoy is a simple way for online user to view, create, share and store their favourite recipes. 
For this backend development project I am going to create a web application that allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) recipes stored within a database. 

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my third milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase the new skills that 
I have learnt from The Code Institute and previous skill learnt from other projects. The primary skills being showcased here is 
going be Python and its libraries, as well as the Materialize Framework instead of the Bootstrap Framework.  

# UX – User Experience

## The Who? 
The project will be aimed at users who want to share their cooking recipes with other cooking enthusiast who are looking for new and exciting recipe ideas to cook. 

## The What?
The project will connect users from different backgrounds, cultures and countries and allow them to share their cooking recipes through this 
online web application and a place where they can digitally store them.  

## The How?
I will be using a variety of different technologies to create this project, with the first and for most being the Python programming language. 
I will also be utilising the Materialize Framework and the MongoDB database program to store user information and cooking recipes. 

The web application will allow non registered users to view other users shared recipes, but will not have full access, 
but will be given the option to register to get full access. Registered users will have full access and once logged in to the web application and they 
can create their own recipes and share them with others, as well as update and delete their created recipes. Registered users will also be allowed to 
update their username and password. An Admin will also be created to manage the application and oversee any user issues.

# User Stories
My users for this project are people seeking new cooking recipes for their breakfast, lunch, dinners and more. It is also aimed at users who are willing to share their cooking recipes with others, but it also a way for them to store their cooking recipes online, so they can be accessed via a laptop, tablet or even a smartphone anywhere in the world. 

* As a user, I want to be able to register to the website, so that I can login and have full access to the web application.

* As a user, I want to be able to view my account profile, so that I can change my username and password.

* As a user, I want to be able to logout of my account from any page. 

* As a user, I want to be able to login, so that I can create my own recipes.

* As a user, I want to add new recipes, so that I can store and share my recipes. 

* As a user, I want a detailed recipe form, so that I can create a well detailed recipe instructions for another user to follow. 

* As a user, I want to be able to view all recipe details, so that I can follow the detailed instructions on how to cook the food dish. 

* As a user, I want to be able to edit my recipes, so that I can fix mistakes or update them. 

* As a user, I want to be able to delete my recipes added to the database.

* As a user, I want to able to view my recipes only, so that I can see how many recipes I have created.

* As a user, I want to be able to view all recipes without registering, so that I do not have to create an account or log in.

* As a user, I want to be able to contact the website administrator, so that if have any question or issues they can be addressed. 

* As a user, I want to access the web application on different device sizes, so that I can view the website on the go.

# Design 
## Framework
The Materialize framework has been chosen for the project, the reason for this is that for the last two projects I have used the Bootstrap framework. 
So for this project I would like to utilize the Materialize framework and gain some exposure to it.

## Colour Scheme
The colour scheme that I have chosen will be easy on the eyes and easy for users to read the cooking recipes. 
The buttons and flash messages will stand out from the rest of the content so they can be noticed. All colour chosen will 
be validated beforehand using the WebAIM online contrast checker to make sure they meet accessibility standards. 

## Typography 
For this project I have chosen two fonts from Google Fonts, the first font I have chosen is 
called [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?preview.text_type=custom). 
This font will used in my navigation bar, headings, flash messages and button. 

The second font I have chosen is also from Google Fonts and it is called [Baloo 2]( https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+2?preview.text_type=custom). 
This font will be used the main content of the project as well as displaying the main recipe cooking instructions. 

## Imagery
The images that will be used for this project will be some of my personal images that I have taken of the wife’s cooking. 
The other images will be taken from Google and referenced in my media section of the write up.  The icons used within this project will be utilised 
from the [Font Awesome CDN]( https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome).
