## Project Title - Share, Cook, Enjoy Online Cookbook

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my third milestone project for The Code Institute
 
Share, Cook, Enjoy is a simple way for online user to view, create, share and store their favourite recipes. 
For this backend development project I am going to create a web application that allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) recipes stored within a database. 

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my third milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase the new skills that 
I have learnt from The Code Institute and previous skill learnt from other projects. The primary skills being showcased here is 
going be Python and its libraries, as well as the Materialize Framework instead of the Bootstrap Framework.  

# UX â€“ User Experience

## The Who? 
The project will be aimed at users who want to share their cooking recipes with other cooking enthusiast who are looking for new and exciting recipe ideas to cook. 

## The What?
The project will connect users from different backgrounds, cultures and countries and allow them to share their cooking recipes through this 
online web application and a place where they can digitally store them.  

## The How?
I will be using a variety of different technologies to create this project, with the first and for most being the Python programming language. 
I will also be utilising the Materialize Framework and the MongoDB database program to store user information and cooking recipes. 

The web application will allow non registered users to view other users shared recipes, but will not have full access, 
but will be given the option to register to get full access. Registered users will have full access and once logged in to the web application and they 
can create their own recipes and share them with others, as well as update and delete their created recipes. Registered users will also be allowed to 
update their username and password. An Admin will also be created to manage the application and oversee any user issues.

# User Stories

It is also aimed at users who are willing to share their cooking recipes with others, but it also a way for them to store their cooking recipes online, so they can be accessed via a laptop, tablet or even a smartphone anywhere in the world.

# Design 
# Design 
The design choice for my project overall is to create a user friendly website, which will have a sleek modern design and easy to read. 
To make these design choices happen I have made the following decisions below. 

## Framework
The Materialize framework has been chosen for the project, the reason for this is that for the last two projects I have used the Bootstrap framework. 
So for this project I would like to utilize the Materialize framework and gain some exposure to it.
